        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Will the server ever reset?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Any rumors of a server reset of any kind can be assumed as false unless it has been announced by Thun in #announcements.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Is KeepInventory on?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No. KeepInventory is disabled by default for all players. However, all paid ranks get access to keep inventory as a toggleable option.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">How do I prevent people from stealing my items if I die?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p> If you die in the overworld your drops will be locked, meaning no player can pick them up except for you. You can also do /back to return to your death point. Dropped items are still susceptible to despawning when loaded if you don’t get them within 2 - 5 minutes.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Is PvP enabled?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>PvP is disabled by default. If you would like to participate in PvP, We have an /arena at spawn, that allows you to keep inventory & xp, and also has item durability disabled.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Is Griefing allowed on this server?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Anything left unclaimed is fair game to take, claim, or grief. If you want to protect your things, you must claim them. Staff will not be able to help with unclaimed griefed builds. However, You are not allowed to target a player's claim line in order to grief areas.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">How do I get more claim blocks?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can obtain more claim blocks for free through voting, you can purchase them on the store, or you can buy them from other players.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">How do I claim my land?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Vanilla Realms uses the GriefPrevention plugin to allow players to claim land and prevent grief from happening to protected land. Using /kit claim in-game will give you a golden shovel which you can use to mark out a claim. Right-click one corner of the area you would like to claim; after that, you then must run over and right-click the opposite corner from the one you first marked. This will create a claim in your desired area. Do note; You cannot claim in the Nether or the End.

              The following link provides a visual aid on how to claim your land (https://tinyurl.com/GriefPreventionVideo)</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Do claims auto-unclaim?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, they do. After 60 days of not logging on to the server, all of that player's claims will auto-unclaim and your builds and items will be subject to grief. However, if you have 10k claim blocks from voting or 5k bonus claim blocks from crates or the store, your claims will not be automatically removed.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Do my warps get auto-removed?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. Warps are also removed after 60 days of not having logged on, just as claims. Unlike claims, there is no way to prevent this as of now.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">

          <button class="faq-question">I see a lot of players with spawners, how can I get my own?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Several types of spawners are found throughout the overworld. However, you will have to vote until you acquire the Butcher+ rank or purchase the Wolf rank from our store to pick them up. You must still use a silk touch pickaxe to pick up the spawner. Only players with either of those ranks can retrieve spawners. There is a 24hr cooldown from this, however.
              Alternative ways to get spawners are acquiring them from other players or crates at spawn.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Is the server P2W?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The things we sell in our store do not give you a direct advantage over other players but may save you time to get certain things. You can also receive any paid crate keys for free through the higher vote ranks, the vote crate, and from server events.
              Payments on the store allow the owner to spend more time running the server, improving your experience, growing the community, and much more.</p>

          <button class="faq-question">How close can I claim land to an existing claim?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You must claim at least 8 chunks away from any pre-existing claims without the claim owner’s permission. You can see chunks by pressing F3 + G. Any claims too close to other players’ claims are subjected to be removed after a 48-hour waiting period.</p>

          <button class="faq-question">Can I use mods on this server?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We allow many types of mods on this server, such as mini-maps and shaders like full bright (More extensive list coming soon). However, We do not allow any mod that gives a player an unfair advantage over other players. If you are kicked for using these mods, you must turn them off to continue playing.
              A bad connection can also cause our anti-cheat to believe the mods you are using are giving you an unfair advantage, you may need to restart your game or check your internet if you believe you are being kicked unfairly.
              Abusing mods that give an unfair advantage could get you banned from the server permanently.</p>
